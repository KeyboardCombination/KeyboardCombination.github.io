                <p class="paragraph">Hello! I'm KeyboardCombination, a young programmer that likes to make Roblox and Unity games. I also enjoy programming with other languages such as HTML and CSS and Python.</p>
                <p class="paragraph">I've been programming in Lua for around 3 years now. I've only been doing HTML and CSS for a few months. I'm getting the hang of it and I hope I can make this site alot better than it is currently. Right now I've only got a few pages working but I hope the entire site will be fully functional soon!</p>
                <h1 class="text-center">My pets</h1>
