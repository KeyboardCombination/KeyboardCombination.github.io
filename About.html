        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p class="paragraph">Hello! I'm KeyboardCombination, a 14 year old programmer that likes to make Roblox games. I also enjoy programming on other languages such as HTML and CSS and sometimes Python.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">I've been programming in Lua for around 3 years now. I've only been doing HTML and CSS for a few months. I'm getting the hang of it and I hope I can make this site alot better than it is currently. Right now I've only got two pages working but I hope the entire site will be fully functional soon!</p>
        <br></br>
