            <p class="paragraph">Ultimate Paintball is a fast-paced shooter inspired by the original Ultimate Paintball from Roblox in 2007. I've been working on it for around 5 months and I'm really enjoying developing it. I still have tons of features I plan to put into the game by around next year (no promises though).</p>
